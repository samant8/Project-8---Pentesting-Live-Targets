# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection
* As you can see with your first load, the information retrived from the database is immediate, however when you add ' OR SLEEP(5)=0--' as the end of the https://35.184.88.145/blue/public/salesperson.php?id=, it pauses for an additional 5 seconds before the information is displayed. This proves a successful sql injection, and if someone took the time to access the database, it'd would be possible to retrieved information in the database.

Vulnerability #2: Session Jacking
* To achieve session jacking you should have two browers one logged in as an admin and the other not logged in. With the admin, you can check the session id and copy it and change the session on the browser not logged in. Once you change it, you should be able to log in.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Sit Scripting (XSS)
* To achieve this, submit the contact me form and in the comments section place the xss attack script. <script>alert('Samantha found the XSS!');</script>. Next log in as admin and view the feedback, you should see the successful xss attack.

Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration
* It can be hazerdous when different messages are shown with valid and invalid user accounts. As shown in the example, when the user enters log in credentials for a current existing user, the message is bolded. When the user enters log in credentials with a user that does not exist, the message is not bolded.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR
* In the page for find a salesperson, each link brings you to a page with a certain id. Once you get to higher numbers such as 10 and 11, they don't exist on the main page anymore. These links show you information that is not made to the public such as Lazy Lazyman who got fired for stealing.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery
* Build a page that contains a form not visible to the user. This form will then submit new information that will change the database.Yu first have to send the url to the admin over the feedback form. Once logged in as an admin, if they accidentally click on the link, it will appear harmless, but in actuality the form is send and the database is hacked.
